1. An integer is stored in 4 bytes, that is 32 bits.
2. 4 bytes.
3.  00000001 shifted to the right is 00000000, so it would print 0.
	00000001 shifted to the left is 00000010, so it would print 2.
	00000001 shifted to the left is 00000100, so it would print 4.
	shifting to the left is the quasi-same as adding a 0 to the end, which means multiplying the number by the base, which is in this case 2 (for decimal adding a 0 at the end is multiplying by 10 for example).
4. [0 ; (2^8)-1] = [0 ; 255]
5. [ - ( (2^7)-1 ) ; 2^7-1 ] = [-127 ; 127 ]
6. the left-most leading digit is reserved for signs.
